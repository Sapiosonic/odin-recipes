# Recipes

This is the first project in the Odin Project's Foundations path.

Bellow I will list the topics that I need to explore in order to
accomplish this task and complete the project.

Main goal:

- Create a recipe website with the HTML learned up to this point.
- Create meaningful and well-organized commits.
