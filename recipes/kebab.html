        Kebab, originating from Middle Eastern and Central Asian cuisines, is a delightful dish that combines
        small pieces of marinated meat (such as lamb or beef) with vegetables. These flavorful morsels are threaded
        onto skewers and grilled to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
        The meat is typically cut into bite-size cubes, marinated in olive oil, lemon juice, and spices (ranging from 
        garlic to hot peppers), and then alternated with vegetables like aubergine, tomato, potato, and onion.The use 
        of charcoal for grilling is an economical adaptation in regions where fuelwood is scarce. Dozens of kebab 
        variations exist, with shish kebab being one of the most well-known internationally.
