    <h1>Noodles</h1>
    <p>
        Noodles, those delightful strands of culinary versatility, have woven 
        their way into the hearts and kitchens of people across the globe. These 
        humble ribbons of dough, whether made from wheat, rice, or other grains, 
        transcend borders and cultures. Let’s explore the world of noodles, where 
        each twist and turn brings a new flavor, texture, and tradition.

    <p>
        In China, where noodles have been savored for millennia, there exist over 
        1,200 types! From the delicate strands of lamian (hand-pulled noodles) to 
        the hearty wheat-based varieties, Chinese cuisine celebrates the art of 
        noodle-making. Picture a bustling street vendor deftly stretching dough into 
        thin threads, then plunging them into boiling water. The result? A steaming 
        bowl of comfort, ready to be adorned with fragrant broths, savory sauces, or 
        stir-fried vegetables. Across the Far East, from Japan to Vietnam, noodles 
        play starring roles in soups, stir-fries, and street food. The slurp-worthy 
        experience of savoring ramen, udon, or pho transcends mere sustenance—it’s a 
        celebration of culture and craftsmanship.

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour: 2 cups (10 oz)</li>
        <li>Large eggs: 2</li>
        <li>Additional large egg yolks: 4</li>
        <li>Iodized or kosher salt: 1 tsp (5 mL)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (optional): 2 tsp (10 mL)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl to form a soft, firm dough. 
            You can use a food processor, stand mixer, or mix by hand. If you’re rolling 
            the pasta by hand, adding olive oil will make the dough easier to handle. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Adjust the dough consistency as needed. Factors like flour brand, egg size, 
            and humidity can affect the dough. Add more flour if it’s too wet or a bit 
            of water if it’s too dry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the dough into 6 even pieces.
