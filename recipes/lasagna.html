    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>
            Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until it is al dente. 
            Drain and set aside. 
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet, cook the meat (such as ground beef, ground pork, or ground chicken) 
            with onions, garlic, and tomatoes until the meat is browned and the vegetables are tender.

            In a separate bowl, mix together the cheese sauce. This can be made with ricotta,

            Assemble the lasagna by layering the cooked pasta, meat sauce, and cheese sauce in a 9x13 inch

            Cover the lasagna with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the 
            cheese is melted and bubbly.
